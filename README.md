moodle-block-quizlet_import

My first Moodle plugin so looking for some feedback.
The block autocreates a moodle quiz from a quizlet set.

The block takes a quizlet URL and a section number and then:
1. Creates a txt file in the GIFT format from the quizlet questions and imports those into the question bank
2. Creates an xml file in the moodlexml format to add one random short answer matching question
3. Creates a quiz in the section
4. Adds the random short answer matching question to the quiz
